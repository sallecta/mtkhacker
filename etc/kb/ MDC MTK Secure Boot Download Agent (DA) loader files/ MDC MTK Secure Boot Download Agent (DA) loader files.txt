MDC devices which have a Secure Bootloader 
would give you authentication or 
buffer errors when trying to flash 
using SP flash tool.

Dongles / Boxes like Infinity CM2 
would throw a Secure Boot! error. 
To flash such devices, 
you'll need a MDC Secure Boot DA file. 
It'll also come in handy when trying to bypass Factory Reset Protection (FRP)
